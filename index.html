        <h2>About me üëã </h2>
        <p>I am a Japanese American woman living in NYC. I am skilled in troubleshooting, data migration, and programming in HTML/CSS, Python, and R! I also possess extensive knowledge in Microsoft Excel as well as Adobe Creative Suite. My objective is to obtain a rewarding full time entry-level position or internship at a company that is fast paced and constantly growing. I am especially interested in careers in publishing and other creative industries! </p>

        <h2>Experience üíº</h2>
        <p>I am currently interning at Penguin Random House in the IT and Content Applications department. I troubleshoot and assign fonts to designers so they can continue to create amazing books! I love what I do because I love guiding and helping people out when they need it. I also previously was a tutor at TheCoderSchool, where I would teach children how to code in Python, HTML/CSS, and Scratch! This position helped me learn how to communicate with all different groups and demographics of people, and I am so grateful for all the wonderful skills I have learned while I was teaching. </p>

        <h2>Academics üéì</h2>
        <p>I am currently attending Molloy University as a Computer Information Systems major with minors in Digital Art and Data Science. I graduate in Spring of 2024, but I am available for full-time positions immediately because I only have a couple of required classes left! Molloy has given me the opportunity to take fun and integral classes such as Database Management, Systems Analysis and Design, and Design and Analysis of Algorithms. My in-depth education allows me to provide innovative solutions to complex business problems at my current position at Penguin Random House.</p>

        <p>For the past two years, I have been leading Molloy University's Anime Club as its treasurer. This role has not only given me a platform to showcase my leadership skills, but it has also provided me with an opportunity to pursue my personal interest in anime! I am responsible for organizing and running events such as our cultural trips to Manhattan, art contests, and movie nights for charity!</p>
